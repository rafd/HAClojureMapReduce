HAClojureMapReduce
==================

Code from live code talk about implementing a basic MapReduce system in Clojure.

Presented at HackerAcademy, UoftT, on Nov 5, 2013.

MapReduce is a programming model for processing large amounts of data distributed amongst several computers. Queries can run in parallel, across devices, and can be incremental.

The goal is to implement a basic MapReduce engine in Clojure that supports continous updating.

The example data we're working with is game sessions logged to multiple servers.

It's recommended to play around with the code in LightTable.

Let me know if something is confusing or broken.
